# Project Blueprint

## Overview

This is a Flutter application that provides a basic user authentication system using Firebase Authentication. It allows users to sign up and log in with their email and password.

## Style and Design

The application uses the default Flutter Material Design components. The color scheme is based on the default blue primary swatch. The layout is simple and intuitive, with a central login form and a home page that displays a welcome message.

## Features

### Implemented

*   **User Registration:** New users can create an account using their email and password.
*   **User Login:** Existing users can log in with their credentials.
*   **Authentication State Persistence:** The app remembers the user's login state, so they don't have to log in every time they open the app.
*   **Logout:** Logged-in users can log out of their accounts.
*   **Home Page:** A simple home page that welcomes the logged-in user.

### Current Task: Initial Setup

*   [x] Set up a new Flutter project.
*   [x] Remove the default example code.
